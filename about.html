     <title>Creating community with coffie</title>
     
       <div class="well">
     
     <p>The premise of Kusanya is simple.  Provide a place for residents to gather and empowerment will occur.  We all deeply desire to connect with others and the residents of Englewood are no different.  But how we connect,depends on the resources and spaces available to us, and in that regard Englewood is severely lacking.</p>
     
     <p>In November 2013, we opened an inline espresso bar on 69th and Green (825 W. 69th) that serves various beverages and locally made food items.  We want the interior to be an inviting place that has all the amenities of the coffee shops in the nicest neighborhoods in Chicago.  We hope to have outdoor seating and a stage for performers that hosts weekly events</p>
     
     <p>We believe that neighborhood empowerment comes not simply through social services and government aid, but also through places and spaces that allow us to come together and mutually encourage each other </p>
     
     <p>Our dream is that the Kusanya Cafe will be a place where people begin to see each other and the community as something worth investing in again.  It will be a place where the community gathers together to hear local musicians perform music and poetry.  It will be a place where people meet for tutoring and block club meetings.  It will be a place where all the diverse resources of Englewood gather strength from one another.  But most importantly, it will be a place of hope where people begin to realize their own worth and that of others.</p>
